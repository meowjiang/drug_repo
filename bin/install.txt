Hi Nick,

Presuming you've unpacked the data, this is what you do next.

1. Download the dummy CATHPARAM file at:

    http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~roman/CATHPARAM_archindex

Rename the file CATHPARAM.

2. Edit it to point to the directories where all your data files live.

3. When you run archindex, make sure you either have the CATHPARAM
file in the working directory or use setenv to define a parameter
called $CATHPARAM which points to the CATHPARAM file.

4. Attached is the relevant source code of archindex:

    archindex.c
    archindex.h
    common.c
    common.h
    reapar.c
    reapar.h

5. Compile as follows:

cc -c archindex.c
cc -c common.c
cc -c reapar.c
cc -o archindex archindex.o common.o reapar.o -lm -lz

Or, for optimization, replace the first compile with:-

cc -O2 -funroll-loops -c archindex.c

6. Run it and see what happens!

Cheers,

Roman.
